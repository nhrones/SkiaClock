/**
 * Rather than using a variable sized set of individual Dot objects,
 * we build several fixed size arrays that provide all required
 * attributes that represent a pool of dots.
 * 
 * The main benefit, is the elimination of most garbage collection
 * that building and destroying many dots at 60 frames per second
 * would produce.
 *
 * We simply activate or inactivate an index(dot), by setting the value    
 * of the posX array. A positive integer in the posX array indicates    
 * 'active', and a value of -1 indicates an inactive index.    
 * Any index with an active posX value will be updated, tested for    
 * collisions, and rendered to the canvas.    
 *
 * New dot activations are always set at the lowest inactive posX-index.
 * We also maintain a 'tail pointer' to point to the highest active index.
 * This 'tail pointer' allows all 'loops' to only loop over elements presumed 
 * to be active.
 * These loops, from 0 to TailPointer, will also short circuit any index in
 * the loop that is inactive (has a posX value of -1).
 *
 * When a dot falls off the edge of the canvas, its posX is set inactive(-1).
 * If that dots index is equal to the tail-pointer value, we decrement
 * the TailPointer, effectively reducing the active pool size.
 *
 * Whenever a time-change(tick) causes the production of new 'animated' dots,
 * we simply find the first inactive index, and set it active by setting its
 * posX value to the x location of the 'time-dot' that is being set free.
 * If that first free-index is greater than the current tail, we set the tail-pointer
 * value to this new index, effectivly increasing the active pool size.
 *
 * This is a very efficient use of memory, and provides very efficient dot-animation
 * updates and collision-detection, as no new memory is required for each 'tick'.
 * This reduced presure on the garbage collector eliminates 'jank' that is common with
 * many forms of javascript animation where objects are created and destroyed per 'tick'.
